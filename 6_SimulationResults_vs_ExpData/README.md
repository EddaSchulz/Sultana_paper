Aim : To compare the experimental data with results simulated using the initial model and the final model

The final model recapituales the exp data much better than the initial model and this can be seen in the following figures.


###########  Step 0 : Merging the WB and Bioplex data ###########      
Merging the WB and Bioplex data in non-MIDAS format: For generating the inpt data for modeling, a function form STASNet was used to merge the MIDAS format of files. For plotting the exp data alongside the simulation results, here we merge the WB and Bioplex FC data and save the Log2FC values within the Exp_Data sub-folder in the INPUTS.

########## 1 : Read in Experimental and Simulation Data ######      
#To get the data for comparison of Exp Data and Simulation results
Step 1A:   
1.) Rebuild the initial models for XX and XO using their mra and midas files.   
2.) Using the STASnet function plotModelAccuracy($simulation) get the data generated by simulating these model. Simulation data saved as csv files in the OUTPUT folder.   
3.) Fetch the experimental data.   
4.) All these datasets : (i)ExpData + (ii)Simulation results form the initial model + (iii)Simulation results from Completed model);  are combined together and saved as ALL_DATA.csv in the OUTPUT folder   

Step 1B :   
#To get the datapoints(treatments) per analyte that contributed maximum to the model residuals AND how that changed from initial to completed model   
1.) Use the $mismatch from the output of plotModelAccuracy function for the initial models   
2.) Use the $mismatch from the output of plotModelAccuracy function for the final/completed models   
3.) Combine the two and save as Mismatch_DATA.csv in the OUTPUT folder   

########## 2 : Plot Heatmaps  ######    
#### Plotting Fig 3A and 1C
1.) Read in the experimental data and results from the simulation of initial and final models.    
2.) Create 11\*11 matrix to accomodate resulst of DMSO,10 treatments and their combinations. The lower triangle of this matrix gets data from XX and the upper triangle gets data from XO. Three such matroces are made : one each for exp data, initial model and completed model simulations.   
3.) Plot heatmaps for Fig3A and Fig1C using custom functions.    


########## 3 : Plot PointRange plots ######     
#### Plotting Fig 3E
1.) Read in ALL_DATA (ie 3 Exp replicates+ Simulation from Initial and Final Models), that was written out in Step1A above.   
2.) Subset only the Exp data from here and do two kinds of t-tests :   
(i) 2-sample t-test and compare XX and XO :    
Store the mean of XX and XO cells, pvalue of the XX & XO comparison(called XX_XO_pvalue) and also XX minus XO.    
(ii) 1-sample t-test to check how different XX and XO values are from 0(named XX_0_pvalue and XO_0_pvalue).           
3.) Save results of the t-test as a data frame(t_result_df.csv) in OUTPUT   
4.) Subset the data for each analyte and     
- filter those rows where there is significant diff between XX and XO   
- arrange the rows in descending order of XX minus XO values(absolute)   
5.) Collating the 1st row(corresponding to highest absoulte XXminusXO) from all the above analyte-wise subsets to form one df and get the treatments that have the highest XXminusXO value per analyse.   
6.) Use the function Loop_MaxDiff to plot this data : Fig 3D    


#### Plotting Fig 3C and D   
Use Mismatch_DATA.csv saved in the OUTPUT folder   

1.) Subset mismatch data for Initial Model of XX (or XO)   
2.) group this data by analyte and find the highest mismatch value per analyse   
3.) Using this you can get names of the treatments that had highest mismatch between Exp data and Initial XX model per analyse.   
4.) Use the Loop_MaxDiff function to generate Fig 3B (or Fig 3C)
