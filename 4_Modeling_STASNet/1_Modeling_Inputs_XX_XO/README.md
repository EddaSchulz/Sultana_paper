## Important functions from the STASNet package

https://github.com/molsysbio/STASNet/blob/master/vignettes/STASNet_vignette.html
provdies documentation of basic STASNet functions and the workflow and for modeling biological networks using perturbation data. It describes the input files and steps for modeling a dataset using a toy example of 5 nodes.

The important functions used in the "fitscript" for this modeling project are also briefly listed below :
  
createModel(): Creates a maximum likelihood MRAmodel using the using the perturbation data(.csv file), literature derived starting network topology(.tab file) and information about basal activity of nodes(.dat file).  
plotModelGraph(model) : Creates a graphical representation of model(the network structure along with the associated parameter values.)
plotModelAccuracy(model) : Produces heatmaps to help evaluate how simulation using the model compares to experimental data.
plotModelScores(model) : Plots the individual goodness of fit for each analyte as coefficient of Determination (RÂ²) 

selectMinimalModel(model) : Function to identify and remove dispensible links in the model which do not contribute significantly to overall fit. In other words, those links which when removed do not result in a significant increase in model residuals.  
suggestExtension(model, T, cores) : Function to find links that when added to model will result in improvement of fit. The function outputs a list of suggested links along with difference in model residual and the associated p-values.
